# ‚ù§Ô∏è Contributing 

This page will help you to start contributing to the project. I have plenty of ideas for this project, and I will keep them all shared with you via issues and discussions. There might be some [good first issues](https://github.com/kirillkurko/kkurko.dev/labels/good%20first%20issue) for you to quickly start with contributing to the project. 

## üêõ Found a bug?

In the case of bugs, you can contribute by submitting an issue. If you are really into it, submit a Pull Request with your fix. 

## ü§î Want to see the feature?

If you feel there is a feature missing, you can share your thoughts by submitting an issue. You can even submit an issue with your implementation proposal to increase the chances for the feature to go live. Implementation proposal allows me to understand it better, prioritize and prevent possible duplication of work.

## üè´ Want to learn? 

There is something you don't understand or a piece of code that works for me is not working for you? You are welcome to start the discussion, and I'll definitely try to help you.

## ‚úã Submitting an Issue

Before submitting the issue, please ensure that it was not reported already (open or closed). Provide as many details as possible and visuals (if appropriate) like images and GIFs ‚Äì they'll be highly appreciated.

## ü´∂ Submitting a Pull Request

Before submitting a pull request, consider the following guidelines:

1. Make sure there is an issue describing your submission, whether it is a bug fix or a feature. Make sure that the issue has **Status: accepted** label and there is a comment from me with a branch name (I track issues personally using [Linear](https://linear.app) and this is needed to make sure that everything is properly tracked).
2. To prevent duplication of work, please search for an existing PR (open or closed) that relates to yours.
3. Make sure your pull request is addressing only a single concern.

**How to submit a pull request?**

1. Fork the repo.
2. Create a branch with the name provided by me in the issue.
3. Apply your work there. Make sure to have your commits [signed](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits)
4. There is no coding guideline currently, but try to follow the style of the project. Don't worry if you're not sure in something - I will help with it during the code review
5. Push your new branch to GitHub.
6. Submit a pull request to the master branch. Describe your changes and attach screenshots if appropriate. (template coming soon)

Once everything is done, your work will be live and available to all visitors of the site.
